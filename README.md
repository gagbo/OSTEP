Reading and studying the book is done with the OSSU curriculum in mind.

The goal of this book is to complement the basic OS learning done with the
[nand2tetris](https://github.com/gagbo/nand2tetris) course before. There should not be anything
of interest here, the repo is solely for online synchronisation.
